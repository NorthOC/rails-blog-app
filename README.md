# Blog App - fullstack app with Ruby on Rails!

Hi! This was built following Rails getting started guide. Here I learned how to use MVC (Model View Controller) architecture, how to create RESTful controller methods, how database migrations work and SQL queries. I also used a different database (SQLite) for development and production (PostgreSQL) since Heroku does not support SQLite.

I also integrated new ways of styling using CSS pseudo classes ::before ::after.
